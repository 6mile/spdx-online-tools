Per the copy of this license at http://www.opensource.org/licenses/HPND Explanation: * Angle brackets hold 'fields', e.g. &lt;copyright holder&gt;. * Square brackets hold optional text, e.g. [or &lt;related entities&gt;]. * A license can have variations in capitalization and whitespace, and still be considered an instance of this template. It may be possible to construct a grammatically incorrect license from this template, or one that lacks a disclaimer, or one that includes a double-disclaimer. That is acceptable, as long as it remains impossible to construct a non-OSD-compliant license that matches the pattern. </notes> <text> <titleText> <p>Historical Permission Notice and Disclaimer</p> </titleText> <copyrightText> <p>&lt;copyright notice&gt;</p> </copyrightText> <p>Permission to use, copy, modify and distribute this software and its documentation for any purpose and without fee is hereby granted, provided that the above copyright notice appear in all copies<optional>,</optional> <optional>and</optional> that both <optional>that</optional> <optional>the</optional> copyright notice and this permission notice appear in supporting documentation<optional>, and that the name <optional>of</optional> <alt match='.*' name='copyrightHolder0'>&lt;copyright holder&gt;</alt> <alt match='.*' name='orRelated'>&lt;or related entities&gt;</alt> not be used in advertising or publicity pertaining to distribution of the software without specific, written prior permission</optional>. <optional> <alt match='.*' name='copyrightHolder1'>&lt;copyright holder&gt;</alt> makes no representations about the suitability of this software for any purpose.
